# 🏅 Olympic Medal Tracker

A dynamic web app for tracking Olympic medals in real-time using a **mock API** (via [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io)).  
It allows **admins to add/update/delete games** and **automatically updates medal tallies by country**.

## 🌍 API Endpoint

All data is fetched from:

https://685a435e9f6ef961115594b8.mockapi.io/samplegames

Each game object has:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "100m Sprint",
  "category": "Track",
  "gold": "USA",
  "silver": "China",
  "bronze": "India",
  "date": "2024-07-20"
}
🚀 How It Works
Initial medal data is loaded from a default object.

Games are fetched from the mock API.

Each game's gold/silver/bronze winners are used to rebuild the entire medal tally.

The medal table is ranked by:

Gold (descending)

Silver (tie-breaker)

Bronze (secondary tie-breaker)

Admins can:

Add a new game (medals auto-added)

Edit existing games (old medals adjusted)

Delete games (medals removed)

LocalStorage stores a fallback copy of games if the API is unreachable.
